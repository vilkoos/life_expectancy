# life_expectancy


Here we replicate a statistical study done in 2013. The Internet use rate in countries is associated with higher life expectancy. The 2013 study researched if that associated disappears when we control for the effects of GDP per capita.

For the original study see: [Is there an assocition between internet use rate and life expectancy?](http://exexstats.tumblr.com/post/49267271093/final-project-passion-driven-statistics)
